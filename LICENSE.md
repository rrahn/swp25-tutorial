In our project, we have adopted the use of SPDX identifiers to specify the license under which each file is provided.

This approach simplifies the process of license declaration as it replaces the full license text with a single line
identifier. The SPDX identifier is a globally recognized standard that allows for easy identification and understanding
of the license. This means that each file in our project will have a license identifier at the top, making it clear
under which license the file is provided. For more information about the specific licenses, you can refer to the
[SPDX License List](https://spdx.org/licenses/).
